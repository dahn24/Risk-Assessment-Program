A significant portion of the portfolio \\ncan be allocated to higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities, as short-term fluctuations are less \\nof a concern given your longer investment horizon. \\n \\nPortfolio Construction: \\nA diversified equity-heavy portfolio is recommended, with exposure across multiple industries \\nand geographies.
